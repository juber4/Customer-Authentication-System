# Customer-Authentication-System
Project Name: Customer Authentication System with Spring Boot, React, and SQL

Description:
In this project, I developed a customer authentication system that seamlessly integrates Spring Boot, React, and a SQL database.
The primary focus was on enabling customers to register, log in, and have their data securely stored and managed.

**#Key Components and Technologies Used:**

**Front-End (React):**

Created a user-friendly and intuitive front-end using React.
Designed registration and login forms with proper validation to ensure accurate data submission.
Implemented responsive design for optimal user experience across various devices.
Utilized React Router for smooth navigation between registration, login, and other pages.

**Back-End (Spring Boot):**

Developed a back-end application using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework.
Created RESTful APIs to handle registration, login, and data storage.
Implemented secure password handling using hashing and salting techniques.
Utilized Spring Security to manage user authentication and authorization.
Integrated JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure token-based authentication.

**Database (SQL):**

Employed an SQL database (e.g., MySQL) to store customer data.
Designed and implemented the necessary database tables to store user information securely.
Used JDBC or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework like Hibernate to interact with the database.

**User Registration:**

Enabled customers to register by providing essential details such as username, email, and password.
Implemented validation checks to ensure data accuracy and prevent duplicate registrations.
Stored the user's hashed password in the database for security.

**User Login:**

Facilitated secure user login using credentials provided during registration.
Validated user input and compared the hashed password with the stored hash in the database.
Generated and issued JWT tokens upon successful login, which were used for subsequent authentication.

**Error Handling and Feedback:**

Implemented error handling mechanisms to provide informative feedback to users in case of incorrect login credentials or other issues.
Displayed appropriate error messages on the front-end to guide users effectively.

**Benefits:**

Demonstrated proficiency in both front-end (React) and back-end (Spring Boot) development.
Highlighted the ability to create secure authentication systems and interact with SQL databases.
Showcased the integration of cutting-edge technologies for a seamless user experience.
This project emphasizes  expertise in building end-to-end solutions that involve user authentication, data storage, and data interaction, all while maintaining a strong focus on security and user experience.
